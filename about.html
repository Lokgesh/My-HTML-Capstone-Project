<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Lokgesh GR, and I'm passionate about web development. 
I'm currently learning the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build dynamic and 
user-friendly websites. My journey into coding has been an exciting adventure, 
filled with problem-solving and creativity.</p>

<p>I believe that great web design goes beyond aesthetics—it’s about creating seamless and 
engaging experiences for users. As I continue to refine my skills, I aim to develop websites
that are both functional and visually appealing. I'm always eager to learn and grow in the
ever-evolving world of web development.</p>
